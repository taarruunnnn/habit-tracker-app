# habit-tracker-app

Project #9 for [Android Basics Nanodegree by Google](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-nanodegree-by-google--nd803)
certification

--> The goal was to design and create the structure of a Habit Tracking app, which would allow a user to store and track their habits over time. The specifications did not require to have any UI components, but I decided to build a usable app.
