# habit-tracker-app

**_Android Basics Nanodegree_**

   _designed by Udacity & Google_

This program was composed of 5 courses:
* User Interface
* User Input
* Multi-screen apps
* Networking
* Databases

---

--> This project was the first project of the "Databases" course (Project #9 of the program).

--> The goal was to design and create the structure of a Habit Tracking app which would allow a user to store and track their habits over time. The specifications did not require to have any UI components, but I decided to build a usable app.

--> Project specifications can be found [here](documentation/udacity-abn-habit-tracker-app-specifications.pdf).

Here are some screenshots from the submitted version (1.0) for graduating :
